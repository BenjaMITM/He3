# He3

He3 is a multi-window, floating  browser, above all else.

## Back story

He3 began as Helium by Jaden Geller, a single window, floating browser. This fork of that work features significant changes beyond a pull request and was branded to the App store as Helium 3.  It will be known going forward as He3, sporting a new icon, but maintaing some legacy UI details.  A current Helium use should be right at home with He3.

## Milestones

### Jaden Geller, Helium 1.0 - 2.0
Helium creator and version available on App store as well as GitHub which I had initially forked as Helium 3, and also published via App Store.

### CD M Santiago, Helium 3, now He3

Wanting a multi-window interface, better viewing support, etc, I decided to fork the single window Helium and submit a pull, but my changes and direction being too extreme, I decided instead, to split off to be known as Helium 3.  With Jaden's return, and to reduce confusion, Helium 3 is being rebranded, and transitioned to He3 but keeping subtle hints to its legacy.

## Contributors

Being a GitHub project He3 has drawn from many others to which I give credit here, and being a good citizen hope to do same for others; Enjoy.

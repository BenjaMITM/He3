<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>He3 (Helium 3), a multi-window, floating browser for Mac OS X, Above all else.</p>

<p>This help will cover the few less obvious topics.</p>

<h2>Key vs Current Window</h2>
<p>With advent of multiple windows, it might not be obvious which is the current or key window, especially when He3 is not the default application.
<center><img src="current.png" style="width:80%" alt="current" /></center></p>

<p>The He3 <b>key</b> window features its title in a <b>bold</b> font.</p>
<p>When He3 is the current app, you can click on one of its windows to select a new key window.
&ensp;To make He3 the current, active, application, hold down the <b><code>SHIFT</code></b> key when moving into a window.&ensp; You can also select a key window by using the Windows menu when He3 is active.</p>
<p>Note the mouse click on lower right window to make key window, but then moves outside to another, but key
<a href="https://youtu.be/F7zlBC_LgCY" target="_blank">window</a> 
is closed on user input <code>&#8984;W</code> key press.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>
<img src="windows.png" style="width:100%" alt="windows" /></p>

<p>While He3 supports multiple windows, these are <i>not documents</i>, not in the typical 
sense of individual storage, file / URL openings, or save dialogs.&ensp; He3 treats all documents
as part of a larger context stored within the user's defaults.</p>
Each of a document's details are either read-only <b>attributes</b> or read-write
<b>preferences</b>.  
&ensp; Document details are automatically saved whenever a URL is made known to He3 or any
changes are made, such a moving a document window.
&ensp;He3 does support normal URL file open and drag-and-drop operations but not save.
<p>Document Details</p>
<ul>
<li>URL</li>
<li>attributes: window size, origin, time - for audio / video URLs</li>
<li>preferences: auto-hide, float-above, opacity, translucency </li>
<li>WebView - Mac OS X built-in web browser</li>
</ul>

<h3>URL</h3>
<p>A window is presented for each URL made known to He3 by either filesystem or web location.  
&ensp; All URL access is read only.&ensp; He3 can write by drag-and-drop to the Finder.  Dragging a
document window title bar icon creates an alias to the document url.</p>

<h3>Attributes<meta name="description" content="read only document settings"></h3>
<h4>Name</h4>
<p>A window name is derived from the document URL.</p>
<h4>Window Size</h4>
<p>By default a window's size is remembered when recalled.</p>
<h4>Window Origin</h4>
<p>By default a window's origin is remembered when recalled and updated when moved.</p>
<h4>Duration</h4>
<p>For video and audio URLs, He3 will catalog the asset's duration.</p>
<h4>User Agent</h4>
<p>The global user agent preference is an inherited default which maybe altered to a custom user agent on a per view basis</p>

<h3>WebView</h3>
<p>Each document window is a browser window and by its contextual menu, can be alter its
attributes such as mute, loop, hide controls, copy video adress, user agent, and when implemented: 
full screen, and download.&ensp; It can also provide access to helper applications such as <i>Share</i>,
as well as access to open new URLs, close window, and access to document attributes, 
preferences as well as to access playlists and their play items.</p>

<h3>Preferences<meta name="description" content="read only document settings"></h3>
<h4>Auto-hide</h4>
<p>He3 can hide and restore a document window's title when moving the pointer beyond
the document
<a href="https://youtu.be/36PrULnWcjw" target="_blank">window</a>.&ensp; This preference is document specific.
<center><img src="auto-hide.png" style="width:60%" alt="auto-hide" /></center></p>

<h4>Float Above</h4>
<p>He3 will float its document windows above other apps, across all spaces.  Optionally the window
can be local to the current space.&ebsp; Note that windows cannot be moved across spaces.&ensp; This preference is document specific.</p>
<h4>Opacity</h4>
<p>He3 can vary a document window opacity value from 10 .. 100%.  
&ensp; This preference is document specific.</p>
<h4>History Keep</h4>
<p>He3 will keep the items seen in a history playlist named "History" by default; this may be altered in the Playlists panel.</p>
<p>The default history "keep" size is 256 items.  Should you need to alter the default use the <b>Terminal</b> app; for example:</p>
<PRE>
    1% defaults read -app He3 historyKeep
    256
    1% defaults write -app He3 historyKeep 100
    1% defaults read -app He3 historyKeep
    100
</PRE>
<p>It is <b>not</b> advised to choose a value too large.</p>

<h4>Location Services</h4>
<p>He3 does not use or require location services, but some web sites, such as those featuring streaming content might.  To support this, He3 features the ability to toggle location services and or disable or deny location for the app.  Note that this denial can only be reset via the Security & Privacy Panel of the MacOS Settings app.  He3 provides a quick link to this app via the Location Services tab of its Preferences panel:</p>
<center><img src="location.png" style="width:60%" alt="auto-hide" /></center></p>

<p>To further simply the process of toggling location services, there's also a menu item to do so, whose state can also be viewed witin the He3 Preferences panel.</p>
<p>Finally, He3 can be told to remember your location preference and restore it between app executions.</p>

<h4>Playlist Throttle</h4>
<p>He3 will limit the size of a playlist "play" to reduce runaway sessions.</p>
<p>Should you need to alter the default use the <b>Terminal</b> app; for example:</p>
<PRE>
    1% defaults read -app He3 playlistThrottle
    32
    1% defaults write -app He3 playlistThrottle 16
    1% defaults read -app He3 playlistThrottle
    16
</PRE>
<p>It is <b>not</b> advised to choose a value too large.</p>

<h4>User Agent</h4>
<p>The He3 user agent string should not normally be modified.
With that said however, you may need to alter it.</p>
He3 maintains both a global preference <b>default user agent</b> - affecting future web views:</p>

<center><img src="default-ua.png" style="width:80%" alt="default-UA" /></center>

<p>or per web view attribute, <b>custom user agent</b> setting, affecting <i>the current view only</i>:</p>

<center><img src="custom-ua.png" style="width:80%" alt="custom-UA" /></center>
<p>This setting dialog may appear as a separate window or an attached sheet depending on the current key window if any, and whether the dialog was invoked from menu bar (default) or status app or contextual menu (custom).</p>
<b>Note:</b> <i>With the advent of tabs, a He3 window may contain several views, each with a distinct user agent.</i>

<h4>Translucency</h4>
<p>He3 can vary a document window opacity display when moving the pointer inside or
outside a document window, never, or always.&ensp; This preference is document specific.&ensp; This video shows from top left clockwise, an auto-hide title, an always transluency, a mouse over, a mouse outside, and a never translucency
<a href="https://youtu.be/xuFqopBIPqs" target="_blank">window</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>He3 remembers all documents seen in a history queue.  
&ensp; This information is saved and restored across sessions.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>He3, provides a web search interface to Bing, Google and Yahoo! web search urls.</p>
<p>Searches are cached within the default history playlist and preserved across sessions.</p>

<h2>Playlists</h2>
<center><img src="playlists.png" style="width:60%" alt="playlists" /></center>

<p>He3 can catalog documents into playlists, groups of document URLs, which can be restored
 or opened by play list or its individual play items.&ensp; By default, He3 will restore all
 document windows left open from a prior session. Playlist items can be manually created or via
 drag-n-drop.  Editing a playlist item is guarded by its non-zero time field.</p>
 <p>The tableView corner menu features a button to renumber in current order playlist items.
 This ranking governs which item are selected for playlist.  Duplicate items can be pruned by
 holding down <b><code>SHIFT</code></b> key while pressing the button.</p>

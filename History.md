# He3

## Back story

He3 began as Helium by Jaden Geller, a single floating browser. This fork of that work features significant changes beyond a pull request but was branded to the App store as Helium 3.  It will be known follwing as He3 and sport a new icon, though its use and legacy prevails.

## Milestones

### Jaden Geller
Helium creator and version available on App store as well as GitHub which I had initially forked as Helium 3, and also published via App Store.

Wanting a multi-window interface, better viewing support, etc, decided to fork and submit a pull, but too extreme, so split off to be known as Helium 3.  With Jaden's return branding is being transitioned to He3 but keeping subtle hints to its legacy.

## Contributors

Being a GitHub project He3 has drawn from many others to which I give credit here, and being a good citizen hope to do same for others; Enjoy.

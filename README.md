He3 - formerly known as "Helium 3", supports multiple windows as documents, each with their own
settings as well as global preferences such as playlists and history, and
supporting multiple windows via a Finder status and dock icon menus.

He3 allows you to watch media, browse the web and do much more while
you stay productive. Your content will never fall behind your other
windows even as you switch tasks.

He3 supports a number of per window preferences such a auto-hide titling,
as well as a customizable translucency mode that allows you to simultaneously
see your content and your work, without intercepting mouse clicks when it's
translucent.  You have the ability to click, drag, scroll
behind your floating content.

## Getting Started - He3

Like prior versions, windows will float over your work but now being
a multiple window application, document based, some setting were made document
based, while some are global.

### Status Icon Menu

By default He3 will install a Finder icon menu for easy access to He3,
which can be controlled by a global preference setting.

### Contextual Menu

Each He3 window provides a contextual menu, which varies based on type of
content being displayed.

### Documents Menu

For content based on file URLs rather than websites He3 document window,
when a file save is possible, will allow you to save the document. All file
operations for He3 store to the user's defaults application preferences,
which are global for all documents yet individual settings per document are
captured such its window frame size, location, title. See playlists below.

### Playlists

He3 maintains two types of information: History and Playlists.

From all He3 windows, a contextual menu item, Playlists, gains access to
all recorded information stored within the users applications default store
for He3.

He3 does provide a means to save and retrieve entire playlist or items,
by drag-n-drop from the the playlist table views. Also playlist items can
be dragged from a He3 window document icon into a playlist item or list
which if "over" will cause the item to be updated.

Note that all playlists saved can be done by the playlist panel Save button
and automatically when the app terminates.

History catalogs in order of viewing, all loaded URLs be they local, remote
or web sites. History is itself a "playlist" whose name can be tailored by 
altering its name in the playlist editor.
